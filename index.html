            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <span class="timeline-year">1955-1972</span>
            
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs of Mountain View, California. Growing up in the heart of what would become Silicon Valley, Jobs was exposed to electronics and engineering from an early age.</p>

            <p>As a child, Jobs showed an early interest in electronics and gadgetry. He attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California, where he met Steve Wozniak through a mutual friend. This meeting would prove to be one of the most significant in the history of technology.</p>

            <p>After graduating high school in 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, but dropped out after just one semester. However, he continued to audit classes that interested him, including a calligraphy course that would later influence the typography of Apple computers.</p>

            <h2>Apple Founding Years</h2>
            <span class="timeline-year">1976-1985</span>

            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>In 1976, when Jobs was just 21, he and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer in the Jobs family garage. Their first product, the Apple I, was a computer circuit board that Wozniak had designed. They sold it for $666.66.</p>

            <h3>Revolutionary Products</h3>
            <p>The Apple II, introduced in 1977, became one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. It featured color graphics and an open architecture, making it popular with both consumers and educators. The success of the Apple II established Apple as a major player in the emerging personal computer industry.</p>

            <p>In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first mass-market personal computer featuring a graphical user interface and a mouse. The Mac was introduced with the famous "1984" Super Bowl commercial directed by Ridley Scott.</p>

            <h3>Departure from Apple</h3>
            <p>Despite the initial success, tensions grew between Jobs and Apple's board of directors. In 1985, following a power struggle, Jobs was forced out of the company he had co-founded. This would mark the beginning of what many call his "wilderness years."</p>

            <h2>The Wilderness Years</h2>
            <span class="timeline-year">1985-1997</span>

            <h3>NeXT Computer</h3>
            <p>After leaving Apple, Jobs founded NeXT Computer in 1985. The company produced high-end workstations for the education and business markets. While NeXT computers were technological marvels, they were expensive and never achieved significant market share. However, the NeXTSTEP operating system would later become the foundation for Apple's Mac OS X.</p>

            <h3>Pixar Animation Studios</h3>
            <p>In 1986, Jobs purchased the Graphics Group from Lucasfilm, which he renamed Pixar. Initially focused on selling high-end graphics computers, Pixar eventually shifted to computer animation. In 1995, Pixar released "Toy Story," the first fully computer-animated feature film, which was a massive critical and commercial success.</p>

            <p>When Pixar went public in 1995, Jobs became a billionaire. In 2006, Disney purchased Pixar for $7.4 billion, making Jobs Disney's largest individual shareholder.</p>

            <h2>Return to Apple</h2>
            <span class="timeline-year">1997-2011</span>

            <h3>The Comeback</h3>
            <p>In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT for $427 million, bringing Jobs back to the company he had founded. By 1998, he had become interim CEO, a position that was made permanent in 2000. Jobs immediately began restructuring the company and its product line.</p>

            <h3>Revolutionary Products</h3>
            <p>Under Jobs' leadership, Apple introduced a series of groundbreaking products that transformed entire industries:</p>

            <p><strong>iMac (1998):</strong> The colorful, all-in-one computer that helped save Apple from bankruptcy and redefined personal computer design.</p>

            <p><strong>iPod (2001):</strong> The portable music player that revolutionized how people consumed music, paired with iTunes (2001), which changed the music industry forever.</p>

            <p><strong>iPhone (2007):</strong> Perhaps Jobs' most significant achievement, the iPhone combined a phone, an iPod, and an internet communication device into one revolutionary product. It created the smartphone industry as we know it today.</p>

            <p><strong>iPad (2010):</strong> The tablet computer that created an entirely new category of computing devices.</p>

            <h3>Apple Stores</h3>
            <p>In 2001, Jobs oversaw the opening of the first Apple retail stores, which became the most profitable retail stores per square foot in the industry.</p>

            <h3>Final Years</h3>
            <p>In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He continued to lead Apple through various medical treatments and leaves of absence. In August 2011, he resigned as CEO, handing the role to Tim Cook, though he remained chairman of the board.</p>

            <p>Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56, due to complications from pancreatic cancer.</p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>

            <h3>Impact on Technology</h3>
            <p>Steve Jobs is widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in technology and business history. He didn't just create products; he created experiences. His vision of technology that was both powerful and beautifully simple changed multiple industries, from personal computing to music, phones, and tablets.</p>

            <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Jobs was famous for his obsession with design and user experience. He believed that technology should be intuitive and beautiful, marrying form and function in ways that had never been done before. His influence on product design extends far beyond Apple.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."
            </div>

            <h3>Innovation Approach</h3>
            <p>Jobs had a unique approach to innovation. Rather than relying on market research and focus groups, he trusted his instincts about what people would want before they knew they wanted it. He famously said, "People don't know what they want until you show it to them."</p>

            <h3>Cultural Impact</h3>
            <p>Beyond products, Jobs influenced corporate culture, retail experiences, and how technology companies present themselves. His keynote presentations set a new standard for product launches, and his "one more thing" moments became legendary in the tech world.</p>

            <p>Today, Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world, and its products are used by billions of people. Steve Jobs' vision of accessible, beautiful technology continues to shape the digital age.</p>
